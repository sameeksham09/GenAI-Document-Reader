Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can generate new content such as text, images, audio, or code.
These systems learn patterns from large datasets and use probabilistic methods to create outputs.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of Generative AI model designed to understand and generate human-like text.
They are trained on massive datasets containing books, articles, code, and other text sources.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique used to improve the accuracy of LLM responses.
Instead of relying only on the model’s internal knowledge, RAG retrieves relevant information from external documents.
This retrieved information is provided to the model as context before generating an answer.

RAG helps reduce hallucinations, improves factual correctness, and allows models to work with up-to-date or private data.

Prompt engineering is the practice of carefully designing input prompts to guide the behavior of a language model.
Well-structured prompts can control the tone, format, and accuracy of generated outputs.

Local language models can be run on personal machines using tools like Ollama.
These models do not require internet access or paid APIs and are useful for experimentation and learning.
